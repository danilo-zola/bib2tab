abstract = {Detailed dynamic modeling of a solar sail requires recording of solar radiation pressure influence. A photon-solar sail is determined by the thrust value and the direction. We define the solar sail’s reflectivity depending on the film materials, the sail design and temperature, the thickness of multiple layers, and degradation factor, with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Thus, this work is devoted to the identification of optical characteristics of thin multilayer films in space flight conditions, i.e. to finding its reflectance, absorbance, and transmittance. In particular, the paper asks whether the solar sail simulates by a mathematical model of the optical characteristics of a multilayer epitaxial thin film. The temperature change effect and optical properties of solar sail degradation are considered as well. Solar sail flight from Earth to Mercury is designed as a simulation of the flight change in optical parameters.}

abstract = {The solar photon sail (SPS) allows space missions without propellant that would otherwise not be feasible. Thrust models frequently used in the literature for the calculation of trajectories often underestimate the effect that the surface roughness has on SPS dynamics. A small variation of the thrust vector can induce a large modification of sail flight. In this work, the variation of the photon momentum vector (PMV) is computed as resulting from the incident Sun radiation, taking into account the absorbed and reflected photons. The momentum resulting from diffuse light has been modeled by using vectorial scattering theories in the limit of a quasi-smooth sail where the first-order of Rayleigh\&\#x2013;Rice can be applied. In particular, the momentum change resulting from diffuse radiation causes a PMV reduction as well as a deviation of its direction from what is foreseen in the case of an ideally smooth sail.},

abstract = {The IHY2007 Whole Heliosphere Interval (WHI) for solar Carrington Rotation 2068 (20 March to 16 April 2008) has been very successful in obtaining a wide variety of solar, heliospheric, and planetary observations during times of solar cycle minimum conditions. One of these efforts is the generation of solar irradiance reference spectra (SIRS) from 0.1 nm to 2400 nm using a combination of satellite and sounding rocket observations. These reference spectra include daily satellite observations from TIMED Solar Extreme ultraviolet Experiment (SEE) and Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) instruments. The extreme ultraviolet range is also improved with higher spectral resolution observations using the prototype SDO Extreme ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE) aboard a sounding rocket launched on 14 April 2008. The SIRS result is an important accomplishment in that it is the first data set to have simultaneous measurements over the full spectral coverage up to 2400 nm during solar cycle minimum conditions.},

abstract = {This paper regards small/midsize square sails on which a field of wrinkles appears owing to the necessary sail-membrane operations before and during the deployment. We collected a large amount of data in our laboratory. Many ten thousands of measurements had been statistically processed for characterizing some sail’s sampled membranes consisting of aluminized-polyimide layers (2.5+0.1)μm thin, and loaded at vertices. Such samples have exhibited area and orientation alterations, as a whole, which can affect the propulsive acceleration of a sailcraft. Wrinkled-sail orientation has been given a thrust-specialized meaning for trajectory computation. Three-dimensional heliocentric minimum-time orbit transfer between Earth and Mercury orbits had been investigated. This had resulted in wrinkled-sail sailcraft moving on trajectories remarkably different from those ones of the corresponding ideal unwrinkled-sail sailcraft. Nevertheless, at least in the current framework, the most important result is that sail-wrinkled sailcraft’s interplanetary trajectories could be optimized without resorting to stochastic differential equations.}

A simple analysis of the response from a low-mass electrochromic actuator for the realization of station-keeping attitude maneuvers is put forwards, and an example of propellantless re-orientation maneuver is studied.}

abstract = {A good model of solar-radiation pressure induced thrust is one of the key points in sailcraft trajectory design. The sail membrane’s local topographic deformations, i.e. wrinkles and creases, are among the main aspects that such a model should include. We have analyzed the influence of wrinkles/creases, as a whole, by measuring the related deformations on small samples of sail membrane, 2.5 μm thick, consisting of CP1 and physical-vapor-deposition Aluminum. Experimental outcomes from our laboratory facility have been processed, statistically investigated, and inserted into the lightness vector formalism. We have used such formalism for accurate sailcraft trajectory computation via a non-ideal reflection sail thrust model. Finally, we computed the deviations of wrinkled-sail sailcraft final orbital states with respect to the no-wrinkle sail final orbital ones for a circular to circular 2D inward transfer. The radii of the orbits are 1 AU and the semi-major axis of Mercury, respectively. It appears that sail wrinkles and creases are no longer negligible in the sailcraft trajectory design.}

Our results show that the BB model was needed to describeappropriately the interband absorption in noble metals, while for Al,Be, and the transition metals both models exhibit good agreement withthe experimental data. A comparison with measurements on surfacenormal structures confirmed that the reflectance and the phase changeon reflection from semiconductor--metal interfaces (including thecase of metallic multilayers) can be accurately described by use ofthe proposed models for the optical functions of metallic films and thematrix method for multilayer calculations.},
